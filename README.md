## What is open source

## when did it start

## what makes something open source?

## how can I start?

### Start your own library

arguably the easiest way. Open source has stages:

- release
- license
- document
- test
- publish
- implement / evangelize

ANYTHING along that spectrum counts. Don't be afraid to release without docs or tests!

If you have a need, write something modular for it, and release it so others can benefit/help

### Contribute to another library

forces you to interact
